# ICAT Virtual Open House


Challenge: To allow visitors to the Moss Arts Center to “see inside” the ICAT studios to understand the interdisciplinary research that goes on there.     

User Goals:  
- Visit the ICAT studios (Sandbox, Cube, Perform, Create, Learn, Experience) to understand the work done in each and how they are (or are not) accessible to visitors. 
- Gather and organize data on spaces, equipment, and projects from a variety of online sources 
- Filter and reframe this data for general public consumption and understanding 
- Design a mobile interface that visitors inside the building can use to access the data based on location and viewing direction, even when they cannot physically access the spaces of interest 
- Deploy the interface for visitors during a Moss Arts Center event and gather feedback    

Audience:  General public

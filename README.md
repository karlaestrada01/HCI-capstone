# ICAT Virtual Open House

The goal of our project is to create an interface where visitors to the Moss Arts Center can view and learn about the interdisciplinary research happening in the ICAT studios at the location. To reach this objective, our team designed and implemented an interface, hosted online, where users can learn about the studios. The interface aims to blend physical spaces with digital information in order to allow visitors to access spaces not normally available to public
The interface relies on physical, printed QR codes posted near the ICAT studios in the real world, which link to pages on the website where users can learn more about that studio. On the website, users can interact with 360 images depicting the interiors of the studio. Additionally, the web pages provide information about projects and research happening in each studio, and provides a map of the Moss Arts Center to assist in navigating the space.

# Usage

The following website appears when a QR code which is located in Moss Arts Center is scanned. The QR codes each associate with a specific studio at Moss and allow users to get a 360 view of that specific studio when scanned. There are mulitple buttons which lead users to a home page, as well as different information pages about each studio. Below you can find the example QR codes we created for each studio
